## How App Router Works

**File-based Routing**: Each folder in `src/app/` becomes a URL route:
- `app/page.tsx` → `/` (home page)
- `app/shop/page.tsx` → `/shop`
- `app/about/page.tsx` → `/about` (add this folder to create the route)

**Special Files**:
- `layout.tsx` - Shared UI that wraps pages (header, footer, etc.)
- `page.tsx` - Unique content for each route

**Components Folder**: 
- Store reusable components in `app/components/`
- Not part of routing (doesn't create routes)
- Import into your pages as needed

**Example**: To add a new "Products" page at `/products`:
1. Create `app/products/page.tsx`
2. Export a React component
3. It's automatically accessible at `/products`
